## About

Pomodaural is a unique web application that combines the Pomodoro Technique with Binaural Beats to enhance focus and productivity. It allows users to set focused study sessions typically consisting of 25 minutes of work followed by 5 minutes of rest.

### What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as "pomodoros," the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

### What are Binaural Beats?

Binaural beats are an auditory illusion perceived when two different pure-tone sine waves, both with frequencies lower than 1500 Hz, with less than a 40 Hz difference between them, are presented to a listener dichotically (one through each ear). Some studies suggest that binaural beats can help with focus, creativity, and relaxation, although research is ongoing.

## Features

- Customizable work and break durations
- Integrated binaural beat generator with adjustable frequencies
- Session tracking and history
- Mobile-responsive design
- Local storage for saving user preferences and session history

## Technologies Used

- React (Vite)
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS (Daisy UI)
